applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with
or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>

do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the
Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices
normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
License.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness
of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this

</li>
<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and
on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
